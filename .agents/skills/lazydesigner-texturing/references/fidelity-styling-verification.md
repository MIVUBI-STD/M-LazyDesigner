# Texturing Fidelity, Styling, and Verification Reference

Load this file only when reference-fidelity judgment, coherent styling propagation, render/PBR verification, or iterative correction is active.

Routing, UV gates, execution path, and coverage planning remain in `../SKILL.md`.

## Reference Fidelity Contract
Reference-driven Texturing inherits the approved visual authority used by Geometry; it must not invent a new interpretation merely because UV islands differ from the reference projection.

Use the Control projection as the first material contract. Before broad paint propagation, resolve only applicable entries:
```text
material/color region → matching reference evidence
identity marking → required location/orientation/relative scale
value structure → light/base/shadow relationship without baking scene lighting
pattern direction/scale → mapped-surface continuation requirement
transparent/cutout region → silhouette owner and render requirement
hidden-but-required surface → evidence or explicit intentional treatment
```
Evidence remains `SUPPORTED | PROVISIONAL | CONFLICTING | UNAVAILABLE`. A material identity marking, major region boundary, or cutout silhouette that is `CONFLICTING`/`UNAVAILABLE` must not be replaced with generic decoration and called fidelity.

Reference comparison is **mapped-surface-first**, not atlas-image-first. Compare the actual mapped model against the approved reference at comparable view/scale; the atlas is implementation evidence only. Preserve Geometry-owned part boundaries: Texture may clarify form, but must not paint around a missing/incorrect mass, attachment, opening, or joint defect to simulate correctness.

Prioritize correction by visible identity impact:
```text
wrong/missing identity marking
→ wrong major material/color region
→ broken mapped continuity / invented seam
→ wrong pattern direction or scale
→ wrong value/form read
→ secondary detail/noise
```
An improvement on one island is `REGRESSED` if the mapped model introduces a material seam, mirrored identity error, or cross-surface discontinuity elsewhere. Do not let atlas neatness override mapped fidelity.

## Correction Convergence
One visible cause owns one correction round. Reuse the latest atlas UUID, mapped-face state, mutation receipt, and fresh comparable capture when they already answer the next decision.

Do not repeat `list_textures`, `get_texture`, face-detail inspection, or mapped captures merely to reconfirm a successful paint mutation. Refresh only the evidence class made stale by the change or needed to detect a likely regression.

```text
FAIL
→ identify one texture-owned cause
→ one coherent patch/cohort mutation
→ affected mapped-surface verification
→ IMPROVED | UNCHANGED | REGRESSED
```
If verification reveals Geometry/UV ownership, stop Texturing correction and return the bounded defect upstream. Same texture-owned causal direction twice without new evidence → `BLOCKED`; do not produce a third palette/pattern variation as guesswork.

### Reference-Grounded Palette / Atlas-Island Discipline
Integer texels; **pixels per UV unit** owns detail scale. Build stepped hue/value ramps, contact shadows and highlights from observed form. Surface coordinates keep shading continuous across Cubes; UV edges do not invent seams.
Unused atlas pixels stay transparent; opaque material does not authorize full-canvas fill. Paint mapped islands plus deliberate bounded padding only.
Pixel art must read as deliberate clusters at normal model scale with Shading ON: distinct shadow/base/light masses, folds and identity accents. Barely visible noise or smooth formula variation is BASE_ONLY, never STYLED.

## Texture Styling
generic palette; copied unrelated texture; flat rectangles/random high-contrast noise ≠ completion.
`BASE PASS → VALUE / FORM PASS → SURFACE PATTERN PASS → IDENTITY PASS → SECONDARY DETAIL PASS → RENDER / ALPHA VERIFY → VERIFY`.

### Render / PBR / Paint Safety
Namespaces: `render_profile`+`minecraft_material_code` | `pbr_texture_set` | `geometry_material_instance` | `surface_pattern`; `render_mode` preview-only.
cutout=`entity_alphatest`; translucent=`entity_alphablend`; emissive_mask=`entity_emissive`. Alpha follows render_profile; planar carrier silhouette stays alpha, not Cubes.
Variants preserve production base role + compatible dimensions/mapping; `normal XOR height`.
`authoring_status`; MERS=MER+`subsurface_value>0`.
`paint_settings`: `pixel_perfect`, `lock_alpha`, `paint_side_restrict`; Mirror after semantic symmetry.
Brush settings/presets affect native brushes, not exact-pixel transactions. Configure only the chosen executor; a transaction does not prove brush/plugin use.

## Coherent Styling Window / Anti-Micro-Loop
representative patch/cohort → cohort-wide; formula/gradient/color count is not quality evidence.
Finish an identity-critical patch and adjoining body surface pair before propagation. Compare landmarks, value clusters, pattern direction/scale and seams against the actual reference at matching scale. Generic bands cannot replace observed detail. This is internal verification, not a user gate.
**No evidence-per-micro-mutation loop.**
Preserve unaffected shading/identity during correction. Coordinate formulas execute observed designs, not invent them. Dark patches may be paint, occlusion or missing surfaces: diagnose the owner before repainting.

## Texture Verify
Reference + fresh `get_texture` + fresh **mapped model-view evidence** from `capture_model_views` → `FAIL | UNVERIFIED | PASS`.
Record capture view, front direction, Shading ON and artifact revision. Blockbench preview is not actual in-game lighting proof. Off/unknown shading cannot support final comparison.
Verify required hidden material surfaces.
`FAIL` → **smallest bounded causal correction** → one fresh affected evidence bundle → `IMPROVED | UNCHANGED | REGRESSED`; same causal direction twice → `BLOCKED`.
Never use stale exported PNG/bbmodel.
