# LazyDesigner Bedrock Texturing

## Activation Contract

```text
LANE: IN_USE
DOMAIN: ASSET_AUTHORING
CLASS: SPECIALIST
OWNER: TEXTURE_MATERIAL
```

Enter when the active Control stage owns mapped texture pixels, atlas styling, materials/PBR, alpha/emissive, variants, or Texture Verify. UV/Geometry defects use a bounded upstream authoring handoff; they do not authorize Cube mutation here. A weak visual result does not justify product-development source inspection without bounded system-defect evidence.


Geometry/UV capabilities remain callable for bounded upstream correction; Texturing **must not borrow Cube mutation**.

User-authorized autonomy replaces approval waits with verified checkpoints; never claim user approval.

## Control Context Projection

Start from LazyDesigner Control's stage-specific Texturing projection; do not reload the complete Modelling Profile or Reference Package.

Keep only decision-relevant context: current texture request, asset/profile label, Geometry APPROVED + UV Layout PASS, affected semantic/material IDs, identity markings/palette, render/PBR/alpha/emissive requirements, relevant approved reference views, current atlas/UV identity, and texture-stage blockers.

If a decision-critical item is missing, request only that exact context through Control. Do not broaden into full-profile/reference loading as reassurance.

## Pixel Art Reference Intake

Pixel Art is conditional reference evidence, never a second Texturing workflow. When an approved Pixel Art artifact exists, consume only its compact visual handoff: identity, target grid/scale, authoritative palette/material/marking/alpha/orientation/style constraints, provenance, and blockers.

Do not inherit production UV/atlas coordinates, Blockbench texture IDs, material-instance/render-profile state, mapped-surface PASS, or particle runtime semantics from Pixel Art. Actual UV mapping, atlas mutation, render/material state, and mapped-model verification remain Texturing-owned.

Use the active handoff facts directly. Load `docs/02-reference/pixel-art/texture-reference.md` only when the Pixel-Art→Texturing boundary or missing visual contract is materially unclear; never load the full Pixel Art corpus as reassurance.

## Asset-Only Visual Runtime Boundary
No RP dev: opaque/cutout/blend/emissive; Texture variants asset-only.

## Entry / Correction
**No Geometry↔Texturing Runtime Surface switch.** AUTHORING↔Animation only: `HANDOFF_REQUIRED` + compatibility capability `switch_authoring_phase`.
Entry: **Geometry APPROVED + UV Layout PASS**; final Box UV locked with `autouv=0`, no invalid/out-of-bounds/partial-overlap.
unlocked/invalid UV → Geometry owner + bounded UV correction; no Runtime Surface switch.

## Direct Routing
Reuse fresh state.
```text
discovery → list_textures(); readiness → list_textures(diagnostics=true, diagnostic_scope=uv|coverage|seam|pbr|full)
face mapping → inspect_elements(mode=detail) only when needed
blank atlas resolution unknown → get_project_info once
atlas → list_textures / activate_texture / create_texture / get_texture
exact/deterministic pixel mutation → paint_texture_transaction
native fill/shape/brush/eraser behavior → paint_fill_tool|draw_shape_tool|paint_with_brush|eraser_tool
PBR/material semantics → manage_material / manage_material_instances
render/preview → declared profile + mapped-model evidence; explicit file integration → manage_render_profile
```
Unknown → `search_capabilities(limit=4)`. No confirmation rereads.
**Pin atlas UUID and pass `texture_id` when multiple textures are loaded.**

## Execution Path Preference
Choose the cheapest executor that preserves the required visual behavior. Do not route through a native UI/Painter state merely because it resembles how a human would perform the edit.

```text
known exact RGBA/pixel coordinates
→ paint_texture_transaction

bounded repeated fill/erase/copy/noise over known pixels
→ one paint_texture_transaction when representable

artistic brush stroke / soft brush / connected stroke
→ paint_with_brush

native flood-fill semantics
→ paint_fill_tool

native shape semantics
→ draw_shape_tool

reference-supported continuous transition
→ gradient_tool

sample an already-authored pixel whose value is unknown
→ color_picker_tool
```

Rules:
- If the intended color is already known from the reference/palette/previous evidence, pass the color directly; **do not call `color_picker_tool` just to put a known value into Blockbench's active color slot**.
- Prefer one `paint_texture_transaction` for deterministic pixel cohorts; exact-pixel brush compatibility bypasses native Painter UI setup.
- Prefer native Painter only when brush/fill/shape behavior itself is part of the required result.
- Exact-data operations do not need proof that a Blockbench brush, slider, preset, or color slot was touched.
- Do not use `trigger_action`, `emulate_clicks`, or `fill_dialog` for normal texturing. Those are maintenance/UI fallbacks, not authoring executors.
- Do not call `activate_texture` immediately before a tool that already accepts explicit `texture_id` unless active-editor state itself is required for a subsequent human/native action.
- Batch a coherent texture-owned correction before verification; do not verify after each pixel/stroke.

## UV Gate
`uv_audit.production_gate`=ready = hygiene, **not UV Layout PASS**; review face aspect ratio, texel density, semantic UV reuse.
Requested atlas size/density are constraints; never silently enlarge; return to Geometry/UV if detail cannot fit.

## First Call
For production blank-atlas creation, pass explicit width/height from the current project UV contract; **do not rely on omitted size**. The Runtime's 16×16 blank default is compatibility/provisional behavior, not a production sizing recommendation.

New production authoring normally targets the approved atlas/density contract; absent stronger project authority, logical **128×128 default, 256×256 opt-in** remains policy. Reuse an already-approved atlas UUID instead of recreating it.

## Workplan / Coverage
material cohorts; palette roles `BASE | SHADOW | HIGHLIGHT | ACCENT/IDENTITY`; form/contact/occlusion/edge/identity/detail.
Face Coverage Ledger: `UNPAINTED | BASE_ONLY | STYLED | INTENTIONAL_FLAT | INTENTIONAL_TRANSPARENT | SHARED`.
`list_textures.optimization_opportunities.coverage.gate`: `incomplete|partial` / `FACE_ACCOUNTING_INCOMPLETE` → no completion; one `list_textures`/pass; `ready` ≠ visual PASS.
`states.varied` ≠ `STYLED`; `review.solid_color_faces` locates flat candidates, not failures.
Variants: `list_textures.production_alignment.gate=ready`; `seam_continuity` (intra-Cube only; inspect cross-Cube contacts visually); `pbr_content`.

## Fidelity / Styling / Verification Deep Reference

Load `references/fidelity-styling-verification.md` only when:

- mapped texture work is being judged against the approved reference;
- a representative styling patch is ready to propagate;
- render/alpha/PBR verification is required;
- a texture-owned correction loop is active.

Hot-path invariants:
- compare mapped model surfaces, not atlas neatness alone;
- preserve Geometry-owned boundaries and return Geometry/UV defects upstream instead of painting around them;
- use integer texels and coherent material/value/pattern logic; unused atlas pixels remain transparent;
- no evidence-per-micro-mutation loop—finish a representative cohort, then verify affected mapped surfaces;
- tool success never creates Texture PASS; use fresh texture + mapped-view evidence;
- same causal correction direction twice without new evidence becomes BLOCKED.

## Stage Projection Exit
When Texturing reaches a review/handoff boundary, return only stage-relevant state to Control:

```text
changed material/texture cohorts
current atlas/texture identity
affected semantic part IDs
texture evidence freshness
upstream Geometry/UV blocker if discovered
texture-stage blocking unknowns
READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW | BLOCKED | HANDOFF_REQUIRED
```

Do not return or persist the whole modelling profile as texture state.

Animation → user Texture APPROVED + checkpoint → Animation Readiness Preflight → `HANDOFF_REQUIRED` → Gateway `switch_authoring_phase`, same task.
Handoff: `target_phase="animation"`, `reason`, `resume_from`, and object `readiness`:
```json
{"geometry_approved":true,"uv_layout":"PASS","texture_approved":true,"checkpoint":"<saved .bbmodel path>","no_blockers":true}
```
Never infer approval.

## Conditional Support — Not Default Routing
Conditional on user intent; not normal hot path.
`gradient_tool | color_picker_tool | copy_brush_tool | paint_settings | create_brush_preset | load_brush_preset | texture_selection | texture_layer_management | add_texture_group | list_materials | get_material_info | import_texture_set`.
`gradient_tool`: reference-supported continuous transition; no extra discovery/readback.
`color_picker_tool`: sample an existing pixel only when its exact authored value is unknown; never use it to re-enter a color already known from current evidence/palette.
