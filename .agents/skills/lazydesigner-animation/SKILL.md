# LazyDesigner Bedrock Animation

## Activation Contract

```text
LANE: IN_USE
DOMAIN: ASSET_AUTHORING
CLASS: SPECIALIST
OWNER: ANIMATION_MOTION
```

Enter when the active Control stage owns motion, keyframes, clip state, artist-facing controller composition/effects, or playback evidence. Structural rig defects hand back to Geometry; they do not authorize mutation here. Runtime/tool defects require bounded evidence and a `DEVELOPMENT_HANDOFF`, not source debugging inside this Skill.


Use at `ACTIVE STAGE: ANIMATION` after Texturing approval + checkpoint + Animation Transition Eligibility when participating hierarchy/pivots are suitable.

User-authorized autonomy replaces approval waits with verified checkpoints; never claim user approval.

Durable Animation policy is owned by `docs/03-authoring/animation/standard.md`; this Skill is the compact execution specialist for the active Animation stage and must not become a competing policy owner.

## Control Context Projection

Start from LazyDesigner Control's stage-specific Animation projection; do not reload the complete Modelling Profile or Reference Package.

Keep only motion-relevant context: current animation request, approved checkpoint state, participating semantic IDs, parent/child articulation, pivot/axis intent, contact/clearance requirements, relevant pose/keyframe/deformation guidance and approved reference views, current clip identity/state, and animation-stage blockers.

If a decision-critical motion relationship is missing, request only that exact context through Control. Never broaden into full-profile discovery as reassurance.

## Boundary

Animation owns motion, not structural rig mutation. Blocker → `HANDOFF_REQUIRED`, `target_phase: geometry` + readiness → `switch_authoring_phase` → resume same task through Gateway; if motion structure is unsuitable, handoff Geometry first. Before keys, representative extreme poses preserve contact/clearance. Do not search for `bone_rigging`.

## Artist-Facing Controller Boundary
Animation Controller is artist-facing composition/preview for transition/blend continuity and effects; BP/gameplay integration is out. `resource_operations` is **not a normal asset-authoring route**.

Particle is asset-only. `particle-reference`: Direct Runtime/Inspector only; no client-entity wiring.

## Direct Routing

```text
new animation                         → create_animation
unknown animation/controller          → inspect_animation
all timeline/keyframe work            → manage_animation_timeline (operation: keyframes|graph|timeline|batch|copy_paste)
clip/native property cohort           → manage_animation_timeline (operation: properties)
existing animation effects            → manage_animation_effects
particle inspect/create/patch/save/preview → inspect_particle / manage_particle
controller state/composition/effects  → manage_animation_controller
nested controller/blend curve         → same tool (native_operations)
pose/time visual evidence             → capture_model_views(animation_preview)
```

`new known clip → create_animation → reuse returned UUID/state; timeline if needed`
`existing/unknown detail → inspect_animation`

Known → Gateway; unknown/stale → `search_capabilities`; schema → `describe_capability` once. Reuse fresh UUID/state; known identity must not fall back to broad hierarchy discovery or confirmation reads.

`batch` uses operation="batch" + batch_operation= for one coherent cohort, not loops per key. `properties` owns clip state; `native_operations` nested controllers/curves. Controller/effect/graph/copy-paste are conditional.

## Execution Path Preference
Use semantic/native animation capabilities directly. Do not emulate the Blockbench timeline UI when the Runtime already exposes the underlying Timeline/Animator behavior.

```text
create a coherent new clip with known numeric keys
→ create_animation once

create/edit/delete multiple related keys
→ manage_animation_timeline(operation="keyframes") with one bone/channel cohort

repeat/pattern/range correction across many keys
→ manage_animation_timeline(operation="batch")

play/pause/stop/set_time/select_range
→ manage_animation_timeline(operation="timeline")

clip properties / length / fps / loop / Molang properties
→ manage_animation_timeline(operation="properties")

sound / particle / timeline effects
→ manage_animation_effects

controller composition / transitions / nested controller operations
→ manage_animation_controller
```

Rules:
- Do **not** use `trigger_action`, `emulate_clicks`, or `fill_dialog` for normal animation playback, timeline navigation, keyframes, graph edits, controllers, or effects.
- Prefer one bounded keyframe/batch mutation over loops of one-key calls when a coherent cohort shares the same correction intent.
- Reuse the animation UUID returned by creation/mutation; do not reselect or rediscover the clip merely to confirm identity.
- Do not call `inspect_animation` after every successful deterministic mutation. Inspect only when required state is unknown/stale or when the next correction depends on a field not present in the mutation receipt.
- Do not repeatedly `set_time` to collect static evidence. Prefer one bounded `capture_model_views(animation_preview)` request across the representative times required by the verdict.
- Timeline selection/view expansion is editor state, not authored motion. Change it only when it materially supports evidence or a native operation that depends on selection.
- Native Timeline/Animator API calls are the intended execution path; the fact that Blockbench UI updates afterward does not make them UI automation.

## Rig / Clip / Controller Budget

Keep rig, clip, and controller as separate budgets:
`rig = transform/attachment/deformation capability | clip = motion/pose inventory | controller = state/transition/blend composition`.

Reuse existing semantic owners first. More clips/controllers do not justify hierarchy growth. If the requested motion exposes a missing pivot, parent, attachment, clearance, or deformation capability, hand off to Geometry instead of compensating with denser keys/controller complexity.

Locators are not direct animation targets in the current authoring path; a moving Locator inherits motion from the correct parent Group/Bone. Wrong parent ownership is a Geometry blocker.

## Motion Design Contract

Before keys, define only applicable motion causes:

```text
activation: DIRECT | CONTROLLER_STATE | EXTERNAL_CALLER | PREVIEW_ONLY | UNRESOLVED
archetype + intent + duration/snapping
primary driver + counter-motion + followers
phase + contact/attachment invariants
authored-key vs Molang ownership
causal event for sound/particle
loop seam / neutral / controller handoff
```

Do not invent gameplay queries/events for unresolved activation. Archetypes are **not presets**. No universal FPS, duration, amplitude, phase, keyframe count, or Bezier target; do not use an animation quality score.

Use authored poses for identity-critical action/contact/silhouette. Molang owns continuous/cyclic/reactive motion only when math is the real cause: `q.anim_time` for time-driven cycles, `q.modified_distance_moved` for travel phase, and `driver → delayed followers` for causal chains.

For action/weight when applicable: `anticipation → action/impact → follow-through → recovery`. Author the smallest judgeable cohort first; validate contact/curves before propagating followers. Dense keys or mathematical generation never prove advanced motion.

## Fidelity / Correction / Evidence Deep Reference

Load `references/fidelity-correction-evidence.md` only when:

- keyframe motion is being judged against an approved visual/reference target;
- a correction loop is active;
- evidence reuse, stale views, or convergence decisions are needed.

Hot-path invariants:
- tool success never proves motion fidelity;
- correction verdict is `IMPROVED | UNCHANGED | REGRESSED`; only improvement without supported regression is progress;
- correct the highest-impact motion difference first and reject regressions;
- reuse fresh evidence/context rather than screenshot-per-keyframe or inspect-per-mutation loops;
- repeated correction in the same causal direction without new evidence must stop and become blocked.

## Stage Projection Exit

At a review/handoff boundary, return only animation-stage state to Control:

```text
changed animation clip / controller / effect IDs
participating semantic part IDs
articulation relationships used
current playback/evidence freshness
upstream Geometry blocker if discovered
animation-stage blocking unknowns
READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW | BLOCKED | HANDOFF_REQUIRED
```

Do not persist or return the complete Modelling Profile as animation state.

## Completion

Internal `PASS` = `READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW`. User approval → checkpoint → Finalization.
Endpoint counts are not playback proof; Molang must serve motion, never a math-presence quota.

Protected gap: bone-binding expressions beyond `relative_to.rotation=entity`. Source/CI does not prove live Blockbench/Minecraft playback.
