# LazyDesigner Bedrock Modelling

## Activation Contract

```text
LANE: IN_USE
DOMAIN: ASSET_AUTHORING
CLASS: SPECIALIST
OWNER: GEOMETRY_UV
```

Enter when the active Control stage owns Geometry, hierarchy, rig-readiness, pivots/locators, surfaces, or UV Layout. A poor visual result remains a Modelling problem unless bounded evidence proves a system/runtime defect. Do not inspect or patch LazyDesigner source from this Skill; emit a minimal `DEVELOPMENT_HANDOFF` and stop this owner when such evidence exists.


User-authorized autonomy replaces approval waits with verified checkpoints; never claim user approval.

## Modelling Specialist / Profile Contract

This Skill carries compact operational triggers for the Geometry/UV execution hot path. Durable Geometry policy belongs to `docs/03-authoring/modelling/standard.md`; asset-class guidance belongs to exactly one Control-selected profile under `docs/03-authoring/modelling/profiles/`.

```text
Control → current intent/reference readiness → selected_profile
→ this Skill → exactly one selected profile
```

Accept `selected_profile` from Control; do not rediscover or preload profiles. `GENERIC` is fallback only. Reclassification is context-only: preserve valid asset/reference state, and never let profile guidance override approved reference evidence, explicit dimensions, or user requirements.

## Minimum Necessary Evidence
- **No per-Cube inspection ceremony** without a diagnosed problem.
- **No screenshot-per-mutation loop.** Build a judgeable form, then gate it.
- `inspect_model_bounds` only for material envelope/scale/ground/displacement or bounded surface/contact questions; reuse fresh evidence.
- `UNVERIFIED` is not a retry command; request only decision-changing evidence.

## Reference Grounding

For reference-driven visual work, the **actual approved reference image** must be in **active multimodal context**; path/prose/memory is not visual evidence. Unavailable → `BLOCKED`. Approved image owns visuals; explicit dimensions own numeric scale.

Evidence states remain `SUPPORTED | PROVISIONAL | CONFLICTING | UNAVAILABLE`. View Pair Map is conditional only for material front/back, depth, attachment, or 3/4 ambiguity.

Before the first primary batch, resolve only decision-changing structure:

```text
identity-bearing silhouette
primary masses + required visible part count
topology / attachment / required negative spaces
cross-view width-height-depth evidence
Geometry-vs-Texture ownership of identity landmarks
motion participation + pivot/contact/clearance when animation is required
```

Material `CONFLICTING` or `UNAVAILABLE` evidence blocks dependent construction. A visible required part must be accounted for as `GEOMETRY | TEXTURE | ANIMATION | OMIT(with reason)`; no silent omission, filler mass, or unsupported hidden structure. Front agreement never certifies unresolved material depth.

## Geometry Hot Path
`reference evidence contract → selected profile guidance → semantic form → representation choice → primary batch → Core View Triad → conditional surface integrity → causal correction → Geometry PASS → UV preflight → user review`.

Nontrivial form: **transient Primary Mass Contract**:
```text
mass / evidence views / must-exist reason
cross-view proportions / identity landmarks / surface-only detail reserved for Texture
parent/contact + symmetry/asymmetry
transform owner/pivot + negative-space boundary + representation
```
No per-Cube plan. New whole-form blockout defaults to Core View Triad `front + left + top`; bounded edits use affected views. Add `back` for rear topology/asymmetry; use `front_left_3q` for ambiguity or source-matched fidelity. Never recapture all five routinely.
Repeated/symmetric cohorts: derive once → one coherent `manage_cubes` batch; no per-Cube loop.

## Execution Path Preference
Geometry should mutate native Blockbench objects directly through semantic capabilities. Do not reproduce a human click/drag workflow when the target UUIDs, transforms, hierarchy, or batch intent are already known.

```text
create multiple related Cubes
→ manage_cubes(operation="create") with one coherent elements batch

correct multiple known Cubes
→ manage_cubes(operation="batch_update")

create related bones/groups
→ add_group(groups=[...]) in dependency order

translate one existing Group subtree
→ modify_group(offset=...)

move one known element between parents
→ reparent_element(id,parent)

rename a coherent Group cohort
→ rename_element(updates=[...], dry_run then apply when needed)
```

Rules:
- Prefer explicit UUID/name targeting over editor selection. `select_all_of_type` / `get_selection` are support tools only when selection state itself is required by a native workflow.
- Do **not** use `trigger_action`, `emulate_clicks`, or `fill_dialog` for normal Cube/Group creation, transforms, hierarchy, pivots, UV, or deletion.
- Do not create one Cube per MCP call when the masses form one coherent batch with known coordinates/parents.
- Do not inspect each newly created Cube after a successful deterministic batch. Use the returned identities/effects, then one bounded structural/visual verification at the cohort level.
- For corrections, inspect once only when current exact authored state is stale/unknown; then mutate the whole diagnosed cohort in one bounded operation where available.
- Do not use `duplicate_element` repeatedly for a known symmetric/repeated cohort if one derived `manage_cubes` batch can author the final intended transforms directly.
- Native Outliner/Cube/Group/Undo operations are the intended execution path; Blockbench UI reflecting the result afterward is not UI automation.
- Normal Group/bone create/pivot/parent/rename/delete work stays on `add_group`, `modify_group`, `reparent_element`, `rename_element`, and `remove_element`. Use `bone_rigging` only when IK or bone mirroring is specifically required; its overlapping legacy actions are compatibility-only, not a second hierarchy workflow.

## Semantic Form / Construction / Transform Gate

Before exact coordinates, determine:

```text
primary masses + must-exist reason
required count / symmetry or deliberate asymmetry
topology: what attaches to what
required negative spaces / continuous surfaces
representation: geometry | texture | animation | omit
transform ownership + required attachment/contact target/invariant
evidence state
```

A semantic label never authorizes coordinates. No orphan/filler Cube; `PROVISIONAL` placement never verifies it. Material `UNRESOLVED` → `BLOCKED`.

Canonical representation vocabulary is:
`SOLID_CUBOID | PLANE_LIKE | PLANAR_CUTOUT_CARRIER | LAYERED_SURFACE | SEGMENTED_FORM | TEXTURE | OMIT`.
The durable eligibility rules live in `docs/03-authoring/modelling/standard.md`; they are **not presets**.

Transform ownership is decided before rotation values:
- local rigid orientation may be **Cube-owned**;
- shared orientation/attachment/articulation is **Group/Bone-owned**;
- pivot role is `MASS_CENTER | ATTACHMENT | JOINT | PARENT_TRANSFORM`; attachment/joint pivot owns the shared relation when that relation is material;
- primary mass state is `AXIS_ALIGNED | ROTATED | UNRESOLVED`.

AABB overlap, hierarchy, or numeric touching is not contact proof. Visible material slope may require rotation; do not use detail/extra Cubes to compensate for wrong mass placement.

### Ownership reuse / variant guard

Before adding a Group/Bone/Locator, ask whether an existing semantic owner already provides the needed transform/attachment/deformation capability. More clips or controller states are not evidence for more hierarchy.

For held/worn, first-/third-person, coupled/uncoupled, or local state variants, reuse the base hierarchy and isolate only the **smallest changed branch**. A moving Locator should inherit motion from the correct parent Group/Bone; do not replace visible required geometry with a Locator.

## Production-Scale Entity Construction

Large counts, rotated Cubes, per-face UV and Locators are valid when earned by visible/functional need. Locator = lightweight attachment/effect anchor. Visible Bounds = culling/export metadata only; animation extremes still need review.

## Progressive Deep References

Keep the hot path compact. Load exactly one deep reference when its decision becomes active:

```text
fresh Geometry fidelity / PASS judgement
→ references/verification.md

user-approved Geometry → production UV / UV Layout PASS
→ references/uv-layout.md

bounded local correction / convergence / evidence recovery
→ references/correction.md
```

Hot-path invariants:
- **Difference-First Reference Fidelity Verdict**: Tool success, bounds, hierarchy, validators, or similarity scores cannot justify `PASS`;
- fix the largest structural difference first and reject material cross-view regression; overlap alone never proves correctness;
- production UV starts only after **user Geometry APPROVED**;
- correction must reuse fresh state/evidence, require `IMPROVED` without regression elsewhere, never auto-retry `UNKNOWN_OUTCOME`, and the same causal correction failing twice without new evidence becomes `BLOCKED`.
- primary PASS precedes identity-weighted secondary geometry; successful placement is execution evidence only, never visual acceptance.

## Existing Assets / Shared Session
Existing geometry is a baseline, not fidelity proof. Geometry owns shape/rig/UV; Texturing pixels/PBR. Geometry↔Texturing stays shared AUTHORING; `HANDOFF_REQUIRED` + `switch_authoring_phase` only for AUTHORING↔Animation.

## Stage Exit

Return only changed authored identities, current evidence freshness, blocking unknowns/upstream defect, and `READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW | BLOCKED | HANDOFF_REQUIRED`. Do not return the full Skill/profile/reference package as continuation state.
