# Semantic UV Native Boundary

Status: SOURCE IMPLEMENTED / LIVE PROOF PENDING

## Ownership

Semantic UV remains internal intelligence below the existing UV/Texturing owners. No second public UV capability family is registered.

## Native policy

### Per-face UV
Eligible for semantic planning and affected-only native realization.

### Box UV
Fail-closed. Box UV is treated as a native net with its own layout semantics. Semantic per-face automation must not silently switch `box_uv=false`. Explicit conversion is a separate user-authorized workflow and is not implemented by this source foundation.

## Source flow

```text
Authoring Recipe
→ semantic face islands
→ density/cohort/share/lock planning
→ affected-only MaxRects plan
→ semantic diff
→ exact native targets + fingerprint
→ native transaction plan
→ one affected-only Undo transaction
```

The transaction rejects stale source fingerprints, duplicate face targets, non-finite UVs, out-of-bounds logical UVs, non-integer logical UV coordinates, Box-UV targets, and concurrent Blockbench edits.

## Proof boundary

REMOTE_GITHUB establishes contracts/source ownership only. It does not establish that Blockbench Undo restores every mutated face/rotation exactly, that save/reopen preserves the semantic result, or that visual seams/reference fidelity are accepted. Those remain LIVE_BLOCKBENCH evidence.

## Explicit conversion residue

A future Box-UV→per-face conversion, if required, must:
- be an explicit user-authorized mutation;
- preserve or document texture appearance changes;
- run in one native Undo transaction;
- produce a fresh face-UV state before semantic planning;
- never occur implicitly as a side effect of packing.
